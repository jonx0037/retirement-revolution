Due:

Goal:
• C-Level “Storytelling” Video Presentation (4 to 5 minutes)
• Tableau Dashboard
• Presentation slides: 10
Project:
• Identify a Company/Organization
• Suggest a “Radical” Transformation and Tell the Story Using Data

Data: You will need to find the data
Tableau:
• Executive Dashboard to help you tell the story
• Evaluate Data Sets Using Tableau

 

Notes:
• Crafted for the analytic and marketing audiences in order to construct and deliver a
persuasive, powerful presentation to an imagined C-suite audience.
• This presentation should tell the story of an analytical project being “pitched” to engage
the CEO and convince him/her that further investment is required in your
transformational story. Convincing your C- level organization executives - it is the
rightmove for the organization. Leverage data in your story to make your story powerful.
Create and deliver a presentation of 4 to 5 minutes and up to 10 slides for the top people
in the organization.
• Include in the data dashboard applying the concepts and strategies we have discussed in
class.
• Create a powerful story that drives radical change supported by data.
• Canva (recommended) for slides.
Assignments will be graded on audience-centered framing, effective use of structure
(storytelling, problem-solution, call to action), and appropriate use of visuals.

• Clear, persuasive, appealing: 20 points
• Memorable takeaway message: 20 points
