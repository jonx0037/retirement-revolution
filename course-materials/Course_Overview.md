Hi, class. Welcome to DS6399, Storytelling and Visualization with Data. My name is Dr. Paul Bailo.

Let me tell you a little bit about my background and myself. Throughout this class, I will be one of the narrators. My other good friend, Bivin, will also be the second moderator for the class. My background is very simple.

Educationally, I hold a PhD in innovation and management. I hold two MBAs. I hold a bachelor's in finance, and I have attended Columbia University and also George Washington University. I hold nine patents to my name.

I work for Fortune 500 companies American Express, Mastercard, Infosys. I also work for the city of New York. One thing I will tell you, for my executive success, it was all about storytelling. Now, we're not only going to be talking about storytelling in our class, we're going to be talking about visualization in the class.

Combining these two in my own personal executive experience has made me highly successful in moving up the ranks in the executive corner. I want to share my wealth of knowledge in terms of storytelling and visualization. I want you to be fully engaged during the actual live sessions and together. I want us to learn and have fun.

Once again, welcome to Storytelling and Visualization with Data. Now, what are we going to be talking about? The class description is very simple. One, it's all about you.

We want to make sure we understand who you are and all those lush stories that are in your world. Most of you are probably like 20, 25, 30. You have a history of wonderful stories. We want to hear your stories.

Only this time we want to hear stories with the accentuation and enhancement of the data. And we want to understand how you will craft your own voice, crafting your own story, crafting your own narrative, and using visualization and insight. Now, the word insight is very interesting. We only want actionable insights.

We want to be able to drive change in the organizations that you'll be working for. We want to make sure that you participate in a data-driven environment where you're engaged, you're informed, and you get to persuade the audience. Bivin and I put this class together because we realized our students were getting stuck on their careers. You have to be able to take the risk in order to drive change.

And in order to drive change, you have to be able to persuade an audience. In order to persuade the audience, you need the power of storytelling, accentuated with the power of data. And the icing on the cake is the ability to have visualization. We will focus on technology.

We will focus on meaningful data. We will focus on creating impactful visualizations. And integrated in this will be the stories. Why are we focusing on stories?

Well, throughout mankind's history, our number one communication is stories from hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years ago. You can't even imagine just sitting around the coffee table with your grandfather or grandmother and the stories that are told within your families. It is the number one way human beings communicate, stories upon stories upon stories. We're not only going to be talking about how you put these stories together.

We're going to talk about how we put these stories together to persuade people, influence them, and get them to move in the direction that we want them to. We will have a number of objectives. I am committed to you to make sure that you understand the principles of data storytelling. There's a science to this.

There's a structure to this, and I want to make sure you understand it. And we want to make sure that you drive this essential component to storytelling to drive a decision. We're not here to talk about stories for the sake of stories. You have Netflix for that.

We're here to talk about storytelling, to drive change in the organization. We want to make sure that you understand how you analyze the data, interpret the data, find key insights, and to put the story together. In our class, you will be giving voice to data. In order to give voice to data, you have to be accustomed to the data, understand the data, listen to the data, and tell the story that the data is trying to tell us.

We're going to be talking about visualization, effective visualizations. How do you build them? How do you enhance them? How do you keep people's focus on visualization?

And how do you deliver the story? How do you do this? If you remember, if you have small children or little children or nephews, it starts with once upon a time or imagine. You're engaging your audience in order to prepare them for a wonderful story.

We also want to be able to understand the minutiae of different story techniques and who the audience is. There's one way of telling a story to business people. There's another way of telling a story to little children. There's another way of talking about stories to scientific audience and also social.

At the end of this class, our goal and my commitment to you is to be a world-class storyteller, a world-class data visualization expert, and ultimately to change organizations for the better. Welcome to our class.

Hi. My name is Bivin Sadler, and I am thrilled to be your professor in this course, storytelling with data. My background, got a BS in Mathematics from Texas Tech, way back in the day. Immediately after graduating, I became a software engineer in Java for Motorola.

From there, I went to graduate school, got an applied degree in mathematics, then went off to graduate school at SMU to get a PhD in Statistics. Right after that, the MSDS, Masters of Science and Data Science Program. Began in 2014. And I was in the right place at the right time.

I taught half on campus, half in our program. 2018, I went completely online, became the director of the program in 2018. And it's been amazing ever since. I'm thrilled to still be a professor in the program.

And we went to our big data advisory board that we've had for a number and number of years, that is composed of C-suite individuals and senior vice presidents of data science from companies, like Capital One, AT&T, companies like Best Buy, 20 plus companies from around the DFW, Avery Dennison from around the DFW area. And over the years, we've had a lot of great input. That's a lot of how we keep our curriculum changing, and which software to go with, and which third-party device to look at. We get a lot of input and advice from this advisory board that a lot of it we act on.

But there's been, I might say, one consistent thing over the years that has been number one on everyone's list. Everyone says they want it. And it's near number one. It's probably number one on everyone's list.

And that's communication and storytelling. Every single person, they assume that we know modeling, they assume that the basics of machine learning and AI are down, and statistics are down. But who can communicate those ideas? Not only who can communicate them to the client, but understand what the client is communicating to them, that they've got this two-way communication, so that everyone gets delivered in the end, what they're expecting.

Storytelling with data, making your analysis impactful. That's what this course is really looking to get at. And it is a deep concept, so deep that we went and got Dr. Paul Baylo to be the principal professor of this course.

I'll let him tell you all about himself. But he's amazing. And I told Paul in the very beginning, hey, I want you to--

will you consider teaching this course? He agreed. And I said, I would really like to talk about verbal and nonverbal communication. I'd really like to talk about slide design.

Those are things I'm very close to, and have been very close to over the years. And I'd also like to talk about ethics in communication. Can you carve me out a couple of units to talk about that? So that's where we are right now.

I've prepared those slides. I can't wait to see you in class for those. But have a great time in the class. Work hard, communicate, practice as much as you can.

Practice this nonverbal, verbal communication. Practice the slide design. Practice the tools that Paul is going to give you, the different types of presentations, the different strategies. And these will be skills that you'll use for the rest of your career, that could really be the difference, and really just provide a lot of value to your customers, and make a lot of fun for everybody.

So I'll leave it there. I'll see you in class. Again, my name is Bivin Sadler. It's a pleasure.

It's an honor. And again, I'll see you in class.
